                        In a distant kingdom, there was a village that had been plagued by a series of baffling thefts. Each night, valuable items would mysteriously vanish from the homes of the villagers. They were puzzled and anxious, unable to apprehend the thief responsible for their misfortune.

                    <p>
                        The situation had become so dire that the villagers decided to seek the assistance of King Vikramaditya, known for his wisdom and sense of justice. King Vikramaditya listened to their grievances and was determined to solve the mystery. He ordered his ministers to investigate the matter thoroughly.

                    <p>
                        After a thorough inquiry, the ministers reported that the thief was elusive and cunning. He left no trace behind and seemed to vanish into thin air after each theft. The king was intrigued by the challenge and decided to personally investigate the matter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One night, King Vikramaditya concealed himself near a house that had previously been targeted by the thief. He patiently waited in the shadows, hoping to catch a glimpse of the elusive culprit.

                    <p>
                        As the night wore on, a hooded figure approached the house. King Vikramaditya watched intently as the figure skillfully entered the home and emerged with a valuable object. The king recognized that this was indeed the thief he had been searching for.

                    <p>
                        With stealth and precision, the king followed the thief as he moved through the village, stealing from house after house. Finally, the thief returned to a secluded cottage on the outskirts of the village. King Vikramaditya noted the location and returned to his palace, determined to confront the thief and bring an end to the thefts.

                    <p>
                        The next morning, King Vikramaditya ordered his soldiers to surround the cottage. He then approached the entrance and called out to the thief inside. "I know who you are and what you have been doing," declared the king.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The door opened, and a man dressed in tattered clothes and a hood revealed himself. He appeared to be a mere beggar, far removed from the image of a cunning thief. The king asked, "Why have you been stealing from the villagers? What drove you to this life of crime?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The beggar replied with a mixture of shame and desperation, <samp>"My lord, I am but a poor beggar who could barely feed himself. One day, in a fit of desperation, I stole a valuable object. It brought me riches beyond my wildest dreams, and I became addicted to the thrill of theft. I knew not how to escape this life."</samp>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        King Vikramaditya understood that the beggar had fallen into a cycle of crime from which he could not break free. He decided to offer the beggar a chance at redemption. He said,<i> "I shall grant you a choice. You can continue down the path of crime and face the consequences, or you can choose to reform and repay the villagers for your thefts."</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The beggar, overwhelmed by the king's mercy, chose the path of reform. King Vikramaditya instructed him to visit every household he had stolen from and return the stolen items. The beggar embarked on this challenging journey, seeking forgiveness and making amends for his actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the beggar went from house to house, returning the stolen items and asking for forgiveness, the villagers were deeply moved by his transformation. They recognized the power of redemption and forgave him for his past transgressions.
                    </p>

                            And so, the tale of <b> "The Clever Sage" </b>underscores the importance of compassion, redemption, and the possibility of transformation, even for those who have strayed from the path of righteousness.
