                            In a peaceful village nestled on the outskirts of a dense forest, there lived a kind-hearted farmer named Govardhan. Govardhan was known throughout the village for his generosity and compassion. He was not only loved by his fellow villagers but also by the animals that roamed the nearby forest.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <p>
                                One fateful day, as Govardhan was plowing his fields, he came across a tiny, helpless mongoose cub. The poor creature had been abandoned by its mother and was shivering with cold and hunger. Govardhan, his heart full of empathy, decided to take the little mongoose home and care for it as if it were his own child.
                            </p>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            As the days turned into weeks and weeks into months, the mongoose, named Chandaraka, grew stronger and healthier under Govardhan's loving care. The bond between the farmer and the mongoose deepened, and they became inseparable companions. Govardhan treated Chandaraka with utmost kindness, and the little mongoose responded with unwavering loyalty.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            One night, as Govardhan was about to retire to his bed, he noticed Chandaraka acting unusually agitated. The mongoose seemed restless and anxious, running back and forth in the house. Govardhan grew concerned and tried to calm his beloved friend, but Chandaraka was persistent. Finally, the mongoose leaped out of the house and into the dark forest.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Alarmed and worried for his furry friend, Govardhan followed Chandaraka into the forest. To his horror, he discovered a snake approaching his sleeping infant son, who was vulnerable to the deadly threat. In a heartbeat, Chandaraka sprang into action, attacking the snake with all his might and ultimately saving the child's life.

                                    The grateful farmer was overjoyed and relieved, realizing that his dear friend Chandaraka had risked his life to protect his son. However, when he entered his house, he found a gruesome sight. Chandaraka, covered in blood from the battle with the snake, had mistakenly been assumed by Govardhan's wife to have attacked their child. Fearing for her son's safety, she had struck the mongoose with a heavy stick, mortally wounding him.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Devastated by the tragic misunderstanding, Govardhan rushed to the aid of his loyal friend Chandaraka. The dying mongoose, with his last breath, managed to convey the true story of his heroism and sacrifice. He had saved the child, but his own life had been sacrificed in the process.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Both heartbroken and filled with gratitude, Govardhan and his wife mourned Chandaraka's death. They realized the magnitude of the mongoose's sacrifice and the deep bond of love and loyalty that had existed between them. The entire village, upon learning of Chandaraka's noble act, revered him as a hero who had given his life to protect an innocent child.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The story of the farmer and the mongoose teaches us about the selflessness and unwavering loyalty that can exist in the bonds between humans and animals. Chandaraka's heroic sacrifice serves as a powerful reminder of the depth of compassion and love that can transcend species, as well as the tragic consequences of misunderstandings that can lead to irreversible loss.
