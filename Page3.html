                    Once upon a time there lived a king of Ujjayani by name of Dharmadhvaja,
                    who had three exquisitely sensitive queens. He loved all three of them very
                    much, all of them were of unparalleled beauty. 
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    On one occasion, while the king was playing with the first queen, he ruffled
                    her hair. The lotus flower on her ear fell over her thigh, and made a wound
                    and she cried out loud. The king was surprised at her sensitivity and
                    immediately requested medical attention for her.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    On another occasion, when he was with the second queen on a full moon night
                    on the roof of his palace, the queen suddenly felt her skin burning of the
                    moonlight. The king ordered medical attention for her too and was again
                    surprised at her sensitivity. 
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    On third occasion, when he was with the third queen, she collpased on the
                    floor on hearing of the sound of a mortar grinding rice, far far away. The king
                    immediately ordered medical attention for her and was surprised too. 
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Since then he took utmost care of his three ultra sensitive queens.

                    Betaal stops and asks King Vikram asks this question: Who among the three
                    queens is the most sensitive? Vikram replies with a lot of thought, "The
                    third one, as she had not even been touched by the light or flower. She had
                    only heard a noise from distance."

                    As soon as Vikram had finished his answer, Betaal disappeared back to the
                     tree.
