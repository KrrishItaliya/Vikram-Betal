                    In a kingdom ruled by a just and wise king named Raja Vikramaditya, there lived a poor but devout beggar named Narottam. Narottam's unwavering faith and devotion to the gods were known throughout the land, and he lived a simple yet contented life. One day, as Narottam was sitting by the roadside, he saw a divine sage passing by. The sage, impressed by Narottam's piety, offered him a divine fruit as a reward for his devotion. The fruit, the sage explained, had the power to grant a single wish. Narottam was overwhelmed with gratitude and decided to share the fruit with his three sons.

                            When Narottam arrived home, he called his three sons and showed them the miraculous fruit. However, as soon as the sons laid eyes on the fruit, greed overcame their hearts. They plotted to deceive their father and steal the fruit for themselves. That night, while Narottam was sleeping, his three sons quietly crept into his room, took the fruit, and devoured it greedily. Consumed by their selfish desires, they wished for wealth, power, and beauty.

                            The following morning, Narottam discovered the empty fruit peel and realized what had transpired. Despite the betrayal, he forgave his sons and continued to live his simple, contented life as a beggar. As for the three sons, their wishes were granted, but their newfound wealth and beauty brought them arrogance and pride. They became ungrateful and forgot the love and sacrifice of their father.

                    Years passed, and the kingdom faced a severe drought. The people suffered, and the king, Raja Vikramaditya, sought a solution to alleviate their plight. Hearing of Narottam's unwavering devotion, he summoned the beggar to his palace. Narottam, ever humble, agreed to help. With his sincere prayers and supplications to the gods, the drought ended, and the land once again flourished.

                The king was immensely grateful for Narottam's selfless act, and he rewarded him generously. Narottam used the king's generosity to help the needy and spread kindness throughout the kingdom. The people revered him as a true saint, and his name lived on as a symbol of piety and selflessness.

                    Meanwhile, the three ungrateful sons continued to enjoy their wealth and beauty, but their hearts remained empty. They realized the emptiness of their lives and sought a way to find happiness and meaning. They eventually returned to their father, seeking forgiveness for their past actions and vowing to lead lives of humility and compassion.

                    The story of the ungrateful sons teaches us about the consequences of greed and the importance of gratitude and humility. Narottam's unwavering devotion and forgiveness contrasted sharply with his sons' greed and arrogance, illustrating the enduring value of selflessness and the transformational power of true humility and gratitude.
