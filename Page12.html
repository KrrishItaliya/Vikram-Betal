                    Once upon a time, in a distant kingdom, there lived a wise and just king named Raman. King Raman was known for his fairness and his deep concern for the well-being of his subjects. His subjects revered him and lived in peace and prosperity under his rule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One day, a group of traveling merchants arrived in the kingdom. They were exotic traders from far-off lands, and they brought with them a collection of rare and wondrous items. Among their treasures were four magnificent lamps, unlike any seen in the kingdom before. These lamps were made of pure gold, encrusted with precious gems, and had intricate designs that glistened in the sunlight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The news of these magical lamps quickly spread throughout the kingdom, and the people were in awe of their beauty. It was said that each lamp possessed a unique power. The first lamp could grant immense wealth, the second lamp could heal any ailment, the third lamp could provide wisdom and knowledge, and the fourth lamp could fulfill any wish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As word of the magical lamps reached King Raman's ears, he was intrigued. He decided to visit the merchants' camp personally to see these wonders for himself. When he arrived, he examined the lamps and was captivated by their beauty and the potential they held.

                    The merchants explained the powers of each lamp and offered to sell them to the king at an exorbitant price. They said that anyone who possessed all four lamps would have unimaginable power and prosperity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    King Raman considered their offer carefully. He knew that the lamps had the potential to bring great benefits to his kingdom. However, he was also aware of the dangers of greed and the potential misuse of such power. After much contemplation, he made his decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    King Raman turned to the merchants and said,<i> "I appreciate your offer, but I cannot purchase these lamps. Instead, I will make a deal with you. I will pay you a fair price for one lamp of your choice, and in return, I will grant you a generous reward.</i>"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The merchants were taken aback by the king's proposal. They had expected to make a fortune by selling all four lamps, but they agreed to the king's offer, selecting one lamp and accepting the king's reward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    King Raman took the lamp he had acquired and placed it in the center of his kingdom, where everyone could see it. He declared, "This lamp shall remain in the heart of our kingdom, and its power shall be used for the benefit of all. It will bring prosperity, health, wisdom, and fulfillment to our people."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time, the kingdom indeed prospered. The lamp's radiant light seemed to infuse the land with blessings, and the people lived in harmony, good health, and happiness. King Raman's wisdom and selflessness were celebrated, and his reign continued to be a golden era for the kingdom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The merchants, though they had lost the opportunity for great wealth, were deeply impressed by King Raman's wisdom and integrity. They realized that true wealth lay not in material possessions but in the well-being and happiness of a kingdom's people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so, the tale of "The Four Magic Lamps" serves as a reminder that the greatest treasures are often found in wisdom, selflessness, and the well-being of others.
