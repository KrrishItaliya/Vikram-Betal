                    Once upon a time, in the prosperous city of Ujjain, ruled a wise and just king named Vikramaditya. His reputation for fairness and wisdom spread far and wide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One day, a hermit arrived at the king's court, holding a golden fruit in his hand. This fruit was unlike any other, for it possessed magical properties. It had the power to grant one wish to the person who deserved it most.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hermit presented the fruit to King Vikramaditya and said, "O King, this fruit is a gift from the heavens. It can grant a single wish to the most deserving person. Use it wisely."
                </p>
                <p>
                    King Vikramaditya was deeply moved by the hermit's gift. He decided to seek the advice of his ministers and scholars on who should receive the magical fruit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His ministers suggested that the fruit be given to a brave soldier who had served the kingdom selflessly. The scholars believed it should go to the most knowledgeable person who could use the wish to benefit society. The courtiers argued in favor of the wealthiest merchant who had contributed significantly to the kingdom's prosperity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    King Vikramaditya listened to their opinions and pondered for many days. Finally, he made his decision. He decided to give the magical fruit to a poor but honest farmer named Gopal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The king summoned Gopal to the palace and handed him the golden fruit. Gopal was overwhelmed with gratitude and said, "Your Majesty, I am but a simple farmer. I have neither wealth nor knowledge. Why have you chosen me for this honor?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    King Vikramaditya replied, "Gopal, you are a man of great honesty and integrity. You toil in the fields, providing food for our people. Your heart is pure, and you always think of others before yourself. It is these qualities that make you deserving of this magical fruit."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gopal accepted the fruit with humility and said, "Your Majesty, I wish for the well-being and prosperity of our kingdom and its people."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The moment Gopal made his wish, the magical fruit vanished, leaving behind a shower of golden light that filled the entire kingdom. From that day forward, Ujjain flourished even more, and its people lived in harmony and prosperity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    King Vikramaditya's decision to give the fruit to Gopal proved to be a wise one. It taught everyone that true justice lies not in wealth, knowledge, or power but in the purity of one's heart and the goodness of one's actions.
