                        Once upon a time, in a bustling city, there lived two close friends and merchants named Somprabha and Mahipal. They were known far and wide for their unwavering friendship and their impeccable honesty. One day, they decided to embark on a journey together to a distant market to trade their goods. As they journeyed through dense forests and desolate plains, they encountered a mysterious old man who appeared to be in distress. The old man explained that he had been robbed by a group of bandits, leaving him penniless and stranded. Seeing the man's plight, Somprabha and Mahipal felt pity and decided to help him. They gave him some food, a portion of their wealth, and even offered him shelter for the night. The old man was immensely grateful for their kindness and revealed that he was no ordinary man but a sage who possessed magical powers. To show his gratitude, the sage offered them a choice of two gifts: a bag of gold coins that would never run out or a small, unassuming mango seed that would bring forth a magnificent mango tree bearing fruit of immense value. Somprabha, being practical and tempted by the riches, chose the bag of gold coins, while Mahipal, guided by his instincts and trust in the sage, chose the mango seed. The sage blessed them and disappeared into the night.

                        As the years passed, Somprabha's wealth grew beyond imagination, and he became the wealthiest merchant in the land. However, his insatiable greed and arrogance grew along with his fortune. He began to hoard the gold coins, seldom helping others, and became isolated from society. On the other hand, Mahipal planted the mango seed with care and watched over it diligently. Over time, the seed grew into a majestic mango tree, producing the most delicious and fragrant mangoes ever seen. People from far and wide came to taste the mangoes and were willing to pay vast sums for them. Mahipal shared the wealth generated by the mango tree with the poor, built schools and hospitals for the needy, and became beloved by his community. His life was filled with joy and contentment.

                        One fateful day, as Somprabha was counting his hoarded gold coins, a thief broke into his mansion and stole everything, leaving him in utter despair. In his misery, Somprabha realized the hollowness of his life and the true value of friendship, compassion, and generosity. On the other hand, Mahipal's mango tree continued to flourish, providing for the less fortunate, and he found that the richness of a kind heart far exceeded the value of any treasure. The story of the two merchants teaches us that the choices we make in life, guided by either greed or compassion, determine our ultimate happiness and wealth, and that true richness lies not in amassing material possessions but in the goodness of one's heart and the bonds of genuine friendship.
