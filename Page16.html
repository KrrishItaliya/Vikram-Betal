                    Once upon a time in a remote village, there lived a young man named Lakhesh. He was known for his kindness, hard work, and dedication to his parents. Lakhesh's parents were getting old, and he took it upon himself to provide for their every need.

                <p>
                    One day, Lakhesh's life took a significant turn when he fell in love with a kind and beautiful girl named Shobhna. They got married, and Lakhesh brought his bride home to live with his parents. Shobhna was not only beautiful but also caring and diligent. She quickly won the hearts of Lakhesh's parents, and they all lived together happily.

                    However, not too far from Lakhesh's village, there lived a wicked and greedy mother-in-law named Sarojini. She was notorious for her insatiable desire for wealth and had already married off her three daughters to wealthy men. She was constantly on the lookout for opportunities to exploit her daughters' husbands and accumulate more riches.

                    One day, Sarojini heard about Lakhesh and his family, including the beauty and kindness of Shobhna. She couldn't resist the temptation to marry off her fourth daughter to Lakhesh, hoping to increase her wealth. Sarojini was not interested in her daughter's happiness but solely in what she could gain from the union.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sarojini sent a marriage proposal to Lakhesh's family, claiming that her daughter was as virtuous and beautiful as Shobhna. Lakhesh's parents, being kind-hearted and unaware of Sarojini's true nature, accepted the proposal. Lakhesh was caught in a difficult situation, torn between his loyalty to his parents and his love for Shobhna.

                    As the wedding day approached, Shobhna noticed the dilemma in her husband's eyes. Sensing his inner turmoil, she decided to take matters into her own hands. On the day of the wedding, as the marriage procession reached Lakhesh's house, Shobhna dressed herself in bridal attire and sat on the marriage throne. She did this to protect her husband from Sarojini's greed and to ensure that her love for Lakhesh remained unbroken.

                    Sarojini was furious when she discovered Shobhna in the bride's place. She demanded an explanation, and Shobhna fearlessly spoke the truth about Sarojini's deceitful intentions and greed. Lakhesh's parents were appalled by Sarojini's treachery and promptly sent her and her daughter away, realizing the true worth of their virtuous daughter-in-law, Shobhna.

                    The story of the greedy mother-in-law teaches us the importance of honesty, integrity, and the strength of true love. Shobhna's selfless act protected her husband from a perilous situation and upheld the values of honesty and loyalty in the face of greed and deceit.
