                    So Betaal starts his story. The ruler of Kishanagar, Rajendra, was a kind and strong King. He cared about his people very much. After a long period of marriage his queen, Prema, gave birth to a beautiful daughter, named Sona. As she was an only child, she enjoyed a lot of freedom.

                <p>
                    She was clever not only in her studies but in the use of the bow and arrow and sword. When she reached marriageable age, her parents began searching for a suitable partner for her. But Sona disagreed with their proposal saying her parents that, “Father, I want that my husband should be more skilled in all activities and should defeat me me in a fight. So you may make an announcement”. King Rajendra was very proud to hear about his daughter’s thoughts.

                <p>
                    The announcement was made not only in the King’s kingdom but also in the neighboring kingdoms. Thinking that Sona is a girl, many fighters came with the thought in the mind that they can easily defeat a girl and she is the only child they will get the whole kingdom after King Rajendr

                    But Sona defeated everyone, and they had to go back disappointed. She was taking on the suitors one after another, among them, was Uday Varma, the prince of Ayodhyapuri. He watched the fight every day, by joining the crowd. He carefully watched how Princess Sona fought and the different strategies she adopted to meet the method of fighting followed by each prince.

                    Within a few days Uday Varma had learned all her strategies, and the next day he was ready to fight with her. He fought too cleverly. Soon Sona was defeated by Uday Varma. When Uday Varma came forward to present himself to the King and Queen, King asked Uday Varma from where he had learned to fight.

                <p>
                    Uday Varma replied, “I have watched all strategies adopted by Sona, by watching her during a fight”. Listening to this, Sona suddenly said to him that “You have defeated me, but still, I can’t marry you”. King was surprised by Sona’s decision and asked her “why couldn’t you marry him?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sona turns back to Uday Varma and said: “Just think and find the reason”. Uday Varma thought something and said. “Yes, you are right. I should not marry you. “The king and queen were surprised that even Uday Varma too accepted Sona’s decision quickly. They were unable to find the reason.

                        The Betaal concluded the story and asked King Vikramaditya, “Why did she say he did not deserve to marry her? Tell me Vikram if you would not speak even if you know the answer you are not a King of Justice”.

                    Vikram Replied ” Betaal Uday Varma had learned strategies by watching Sona’s strategies while fighting just as someone learns from his teacher. In Bhartiya Sanskruti a teacher cannot marry his student. In Bhartiya Sanskruti’s father, mother and teacher are all like a God.

                        As Sona realized that Uday Varma was first her student and then a suitor and she was not willing to accept that relationship for marriage. Uday Varma too thought in the same manner and realized that he could not marry Sona. As the king spoke a word so Betaal flew back to the tree carrying the corpse along with him. Vikram with his sword in his hand went after the Betaal once again.
