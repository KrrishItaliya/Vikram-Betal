                        <p>
                            In a picturesque coastal village, there lived three fishermen named Raman, Somu, and Gopal. They were not only close friends but also well-known for their exceptional fishing skills. Every day, they set out to sea together in their small fishing boat, casting their nets into the deep waters. Despite their camaraderie, they had different aspirations in life. Raman wished for immense wealth, Somu desired unsurpassed strength, and Gopal longed for unending knowledge.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            One fateful day, while casting their nets into the ocean, they pulled up an extraordinary golden fish. The fish, with shimmering scales and wise eyes, spoke to them, <i> "I am not an ordinary fish but a magical one. If you release me back into the sea, I will grant each of you a single wish."</i>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The three fishermen were astounded by the fish's words but decided to seize the opportunity to fulfill their deepest desires. Raman, driven by his desire for wealth, wished for a treasure chest filled with gold. Somu, with dreams of unmatched strength, wished to become the strongest man in the world. Gopal, ever in pursuit of knowledge, wished for the wisdom to comprehend the mysteries of the universe.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The magical fish granted their wishes, and instantly, Raman's boat was filled with gold, Somu felt a newfound strength coursing through his veins, and Gopal's mind expanded with boundless knowledge. However, their elation was short-lived, for the consequences of their wishes soon became apparent.

                                    Raman's insatiable greed led him to become miserly and heartless, hoarding his wealth and causing misery to those around him. Somu's newfound strength turned him into a tyrant, using his power to intimidate and oppress others. Gopal's overwhelming wisdom brought isolation, as he became consumed by the pursuit of knowledge, neglecting the world around him.
                                </p>
                            </aside>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Realizing the dire consequences of their wishes, the three fishermen regretted their decisions and longed for the simple, contented lives they once led. They decided to return to the magical fish and seek a way to undo their wishes.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Upon finding the golden fish once more, they humbly explained their remorse and asked for a way to reverse their wishes. The wise fish, seeing the sincerity of their regret, granted their request, and their wishes were undone. Raman's wealth disappeared, Somu's strength returned to its original state, and Gopal's mind was free from the overwhelming burden of infinite knowledge.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The three fishermen returned to their humble fishing boat, grateful for the lesson they had learned. They now understood the importance of balance in life and the value of contentment. They continued to fish together, cherishing their friendship and the simple pleasures of their coastal village.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The story of the three fishermen teaches us about the dangers of unchecked desires and the importance of balance and contentment in life. It reminds us that wealth, strength, and knowledge are meaningful only when used responsibly and in harmony with the well-being of others.
